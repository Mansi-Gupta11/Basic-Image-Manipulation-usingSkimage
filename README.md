# Overview
This project is designed to introduce beginners to image processing using the NumPy library in Python. You'll learn and explore basic image manipulation techniques such as resizing, filtering, and color adjustments. This project is an ideal starting point for those interested in digital image processing.

# Key Objectives
Learn the basics of digital image processing.
Gain practical experience in using Python and the NumPy library for image manipulation.
Explore techniques like resizing, filtering, and color adjustments.
Understand the project structure and how to work with image files.

# Technology Stack
* Python: The primary programming language for the project.
* NumPy: A fundamental library for numerical operations, often used in image processing.
* Jupyter Notebook (optional): Useful for creating interactive image processing tutorials and demonstrations.

# Features
* Resizing:

    Change the dimensions of an image according to your requirements.
    Maintain the aspect ratio or specify custom width and height.
    Filtering:
    
    Apply various filters to modify the appearance of an image.
    Supported filters may include grayscale, blur, RGB  and more.

* Color Adjustments:

    Enhance or modify the colors in the image.
    Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, and other parameters.
    Save the Output:

# Output
Save the manipulated image as a separate file.
Keep the original image intact for comparison.
